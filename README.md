Basic Template to Get GraphQL Server on Firebase Cloud Function

This example has been created with  Apollo Server v3 and Tyepscript.   In order to setup your system, you will need to download the serviceAccount.json from firebase and create an .env file.    After that  all you need to is build your GraphQL API as normal.

I would recommend creating separate files for the TypeDefs , Queries, Mutations and Resolvers.  The purpose of this template is to just show that it is possible to get a GraphQL API on firebase.
